# Average
`average` is bash command line utility  which computes the average
of a given set of numbers to two decimal places.

It's useful for quick calculations where you don't feel like launching a
separate `bc` session, but staying in bash is not an option because floating
point numbers are not supported.

## Sample Usage
```shell
  > average 1 2
  1.50
  > average 1.4 1.5 1.6
  1.50
  ```

 ## Installation
Clone or copy to your local drive.   
`cd` into the average folder.  
Set permissions using `chmod +x average`.  
Move using `sudo cp average /usr/local/bin/`    
Open a new window and you're good to go.
